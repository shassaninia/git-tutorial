After creating a repository on github...

1. git clone <repo-address> = Pulls down created repository on github
                              and puts creates a copy of it on your
                              local machine

2. git remote -v = Shows where git will fetch changes from and push changes repository

3. git remote set-url origin <repo-url> = This will change where you want to fetch/pull changes.
                                          Now when we tell git to push to the origin, it will
                                          push to the url we url

4. git push origin <branch-name> = Push changes to branch with the name <branch-name>
